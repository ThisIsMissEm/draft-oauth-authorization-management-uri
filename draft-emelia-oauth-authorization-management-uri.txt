Abstract

   This specification defines a authorization_management_uri property
   for the OAuth Authorization Server Metadata ([RFC8414]), which allows
   an authorization server to specify a URI through which the user may
   manage the authorized clients that have access to their account.

1.  Introduction

   An OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] client may wish to provide access to a web-
   based UI at which a user can manage the applications authorized to
   access their account with the Authorization Server.  This is a
   feature many Authorization Servers already support, however, when you
   don't have a primary service for the Authorization Server, there may
   be no clear path for a user to access this management page.  This is
   especially true for decentralized social web applications where the
   mapping between Authorization Servers and Clients is many to many.

   This specification defines the new property of
   authorization_management_uri for the OAuth Authorization Server
   Metadata, as defined in [RFC8414].  This URI should point to a
   website at which the user can manage the authorizations that they
   have granted with their Authorization Server (for example, to revoke
   any client or active session, or review the security history of their
   account).

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Authorization Management UI

   An Authorization Server may provide a user interface through which
   users can manage the OAuth Clients that have access to their account,
   such that users can manage their account security with the
   Authorization Server.  This user interface is typically at an URI
   specific to the Authorization Server implementation, and requires
   authentication to access.

   This specification does not define specifics of the user interface,
   however, recommends that the user interface allows a user to manage
   their account security and authorized clients with the Authorization
   Server, for example, allowing them to see all authorized clients that
   have access to their account.

   To allow OAuth Clients to discover the URI of this user interface,
   this specification defines the new property
   authorization_management_uri for the OAuth Authorization Server
   Metadata, as defined in [RFC8414].

4.  Security Considerations

   This specification does not define how the Authorization Server
   should security the authorization management UI.  Authorization
   Servers should take appropriate measures to ensure that the user is
   authenticated and authorized to view the authorization management UI.

   The OAuth Client MUST NOT open the authorization_management_uri in a
   webview or similar embedded browser, and instead delegate that to the
   users' default browser, such that the OAuth Client has no access to
   the account credentials or to other sensitive data.

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  OAuth Authorization Server Metadata Registry

   The following authorization server metadata value is defined by this
   specification and registered in the IANA "OAuth Authorization Server
   Metadata" registry established in OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server
   Metadata [RFC8414].

   *  Metadata Name: authorization_management_uri

   *  Metadata Description: URI of the authorization management user
      interface provided by the Authorization Server.

   *  Change Controller: IETF

   *  Specification Document: [draft-emelia-oauth-authorization-
      management-uri-latest]
